## Preface 

<img src="https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble/blob/master/man/figures/logo.png?raw=true" align="right" />

I have [introduced tsibble](https://blog.earo.me/2018/02/06/tsibble-or-tibbletime/) before in comparison with another package. Now I'd like to reintroduce [**tsibble**](http://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble) (bold for package) to you and highlight the role *tsibble* (italic for data structure) plays in tidy time series analysis.

The development of the **tsibble** package has been taking place since July 2017, and `v0.6.2` has landed on CRAN in mid-December. Yup, there have been 14 CRAN releases since the initial release, and it has evolved substantially. I'm confident in the *tsibble*'s data structure and software design, so the lifecycle badge has been removed, thus declaring the maturity of this version. 

```{r fun-nycbikes, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
read_nycbikes <- function(year) {
  today <- Sys.Date()
  mth <- 12
  if (year == format(today, "%Y")) {
    mth <- as.integer(format(today, "%m")) - 1
  }
  mths <- formatC(seq_len(mth), width = 2, flag = "0")
  yrmths <- paste0(year, mths)
  temp_dir <- tempdir()
  url <- glue::glue("https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/JC-{yrmths}-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip")
  file <- basename(url)
  dest_file <- fs::path(temp_dir, file)
  purrr::map2(url, dest_file, ~ download.file(.x, .y, quiet = TRUE))
  dat <- purrr::map_dfr(dest_file,
    ~ readr::read_csv(., locale = readr::locale(tz = "America/New_York"))
  )
  fs::dir_create("data")
  readr::write_rds(dat, here::here("static", "data", "nycbikes18.rds"))
}
read_nycbikes(year = 2018)
```

## Motivation

```{r motivation, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Can we flatten the lumpy path of converting raw temporal data to model-ready objects?"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/motivation.png")
```

If data comes with a time variable, it is referred to as "temporal data". Data arrives in many formats, so does time. However most existing time series objects, particularly R's native time series object (`ts`), are model-focused assuming a matrix with implicit time indices. Figure \@ref(fig:motivation) expresses the lumpy path to get from wild temporal data into model-ready objects, with myriads of ad hoc and duplicated efforts. 

However, the temporal data pre-processing can be largely formalised,  and the tools provided by **tsibble** do this, and more. It provides tidy temporal data abstraction and lays a pipeline infrastructure for streamlining the time series workflow including transformation, visualisation and modelling. Figure \@ref(fig:data-science) illustrates how it fits into the tidy workflow model. Current time series objects feed into the framework solely at the modelling stage, expecting the analyst to take care of anything else needed to get to this stage. The diagram correspondingly would place the model at the centre of the analytical universe, and all the transformations, visualisations would hinge on that format. This is contrary to the tidyverse conceptualisation, which wholisticlly captures the full data workflow. The choice of *tsibble*'s abstraction arises from a data-centric perspective, which accommodates all of the operations that are to be performed on the data. Users who are already familiar with the tidyverse, will experience a gentle learning curve for mastering [**tsibble**](https://pkg.earo.me/tsibble/reference/index.html) and glide into temporal data analysis with low cognitive load.

```{r data-science, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Where do temporal data, tsibble and current time series objects feed in the data science pipeline?"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/ds-pipeline.png")
```

## tsibble = key + index

```{r nycbikes18, echo = FALSE}
nycbikes18 <- readr::read_rds(here::here("static", "data", "nycbikes18.rds"))
```

We're going to explore [Citi bike trips in New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), with the focus on temporal context. The dataset comprises `r format(NROW(nycbikes18), big.mark = ",")` trips from January 2018 till November, each connecting to its bike id, duration, station's geography and rider's demography.

```{r print-nycbikes18}
nycbikes18
```

It arrives in the "melted" format, where each observation describes a trip event about a registered bike at a particular time point. Each bike (`bikeid`) is the observational unit that we'd like to study over time, forming the "key"; its starting time (`starttime`) provides the time basis. Whilst creating a *tsibble*, we have to declare the key and index. The data is all about events with irregularly spaced in time, thus specifying `regular = FALSE`.

```{r create-tsibble, message = FALSE}
library(tsibble)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
nycbikes_ts <- nycbikes18 %>% 
  as_tsibble(key = id(bikeid), index = starttime, regular = FALSE)
```

A check with `validate = TRUE` is performed during the construction of a *tsibble* to validate if the key and index determine distinct rows. Duplicates signal a data quality issue, which would likely affect subsequent analyses and hence decision making. Users are encouraged to gaze at data early and reason the process of data cleaning. `duplicates()` helps to find identical key-index entries. Unique key-index pairs ensure a *tsibble* to be a valid input for time series analytics and models.

Some types of operation assume an input in a strict temporal order, such as `lag()`, `lead()` and `difference()`. Therefore the ordering of data rows is arranged in the first place by the key and then index from past to recent.

The print output of a tibble (yes, tibble, not tsibble) gives a quick glimpse at the data, and the *tsibble*'s print method adds more contextual information. Alongside the data dimension, we are informed by the time interval (`[!]` for irregularity) and index's time zone if it's `POSIXct`; the "key" variables are reported, with the number of units in the data. 900 bikes have served `r format(NROW(nycbikes18), big.mark = ",")` trips in 2018. Displaying time zones is useful too, because time zones associated with `POSIXct` are concealed in data frames. Time zone is a critical piece when manipulating time. Especially, the data time zone is neither "UTC" nor my local time zone ("Australia/Melbourne"). When parsing characters to date-times, lubridate functions (such as `ymd_hms()`) default to "UTC" whereas base functions (such as `as.POSIXct()`) sets to local time zone.

```{r print}
nycbikes_ts
```

## Column-wise tidyverse verbs

*Tsibble* is essentially a tibble with extra contextual semantics: key and index. The tidyverse methods can be naturally applied to a *tsibble*. Row-wise verbs, for example `filter()` and `arrange()`, work for a *tsibble* in exactly the same way as a general data frame, but column-wise verbs behave differently yet intentionally.

* The index column cannot be dropped.

```{r select1, error = TRUE}
nycbikes_ts %>% 
  select(-starttime)
```

* Column selection always includes the index. Explicitly selecting the index will suppress the message.

```{r select2}
nycbikes_ts %>% 
  select(bikeid, tripduration)
```

* Modifying the key variable may result in an invalid *tsibble*, thus issuing an error.

```{r mutate, error = TRUE}
nycbikes_ts %>% 
  mutate(bikeid = 2018L)
```

* Summarising a *tsibble* reduces to a sequence of unique time points instead of a single value.

```{r summarise}
nycbikes_ts %>% 
  summarise(ntrip = n())
```

If a *tsibble* cannot be maintained in the output of a pipeline module, for example the index is dropped, an error informs users of the problem and suggests alternatives. This avoids negatively surprising users and reminds them of time context.

## New time-based verbs

A few new verbs are introduced to make time-aware manipulation a little easier. One of the frequently used operations is subsetting time window. If multiple time windows (for example winter and summer months) are to be picked, we have to set time zones and figure out where to put `|` and `&` if using dplyr `filter()`.

```{r filter, eval = FALSE}
tzone <- "America/New_York"
nycbikes_ts %>% 
  filter(
    starttime <= ymd("2018-02-28", tz = tzone) |
    starttime >= ymd("2018-07-01", tz = tzone),
    starttime <= ymd("2018-08-31", tz = tzone)
  )
```

*Tsibble* knows the index coupled with time zone, and thereby a shorthand `filter_index()` is for conveniently filtering time. Initially I was hesitant to add this feature, but it is too verbose when involving time zone specification. The resulting equivalent saves us a few keystrokes without losing much expressiveness.

```{r filter-index}
nycbikes_ts %>% 
  filter_index(~ "2018-02", "2018-07" ~ "2018-08")
```

This event data needs some aggregation to be more informative. It is common to aggregate to less granular time intervals for temporal data. `index_by()` provides a means to prepare grouping for time index by calling an arbitrary function to the index. Lubridate's functions such as `floor_date()`, `celling_date()` and `round_date()` are helpful to do all sorts of sub-daily rounding; `as_date()` and `year()` help transit to daily and annual numbers respectively. `yearweek()`, `yearmonth()` and `yearquarter()` in the **tsibble** cover other time ranges. Here we are interested in hourly tallies using `floor_date()`. As you may notice, the new variable `starthour` is part of groupings, prefixed by `@`.

```{r index-by0}
nycbikes_ts %>% 
  index_by(starthour = floor_date(starttime, unit = "1 hour"))
```

In spirit of `group_by()`, `index_by()` takes effect in conjunction with succeeding operations for example `summarise()`. The following snippet is how we achieve in computing the number of trips every hour. Have you noticed that the displayed interval switches from irregular `[!]` to one hour `[1h]`?

```{r index-by}
hourly_trips <- nycbikes_ts %>% 
  index_by(starthour = floor_date(starttime, unit = "1 hour")) %>% 
  summarise(ntrips = n()) %>% 
  print()
```

There are a handful of functions for [handling implicit missing values](https://pkg.earo.me/tsibble/articles/implicit-na.html), all suffixed with `_gaps()`:

1. `has_gaps()` checks if there exists implicit missingness.
2. `scan_gaps()` reports all implicit missing observations.
3. `count_gaps()` summarises the time ranges that are absent from the data.
4. `fill_gaps()` turns them into explicit ones, along with filling in gaps by values or functions.

The majority of time gaps congregate between 1am and 5am. We should be able to conclude that the data is not recorded because of no bike use.

```{r gaps-plots, fig.height = 3}
scan_gaps(hourly_trips) %>% 
  print() %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(starthour)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Filling in gaps with `ntrips = 0L` gives us a complete *tsibble*, otherwise `NA` for gaps in `ntrips`.

```{r fill-gaps}
full_trips <- hourly_trips %>% 
  fill_gaps(ntrips = 0L)
```

Hourly tallies for winter and summer months are laid out in the calendar format using [`sugrrants::facet_calendar()`](https://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants/reference/facet-calendar.html). The bike usage is primarily driven by commuters in working days. The pattern on July 4th pops out like a weekend due to Independence day in US. No surprise, New Yorkers bike more in summer than winter time.

```{r calendar, fig.height = 8}
full_trips %>% 
  filter_index(~ "2018-02", "2018-07" ~ "2018-08") %>% 
  mutate(date = as_date(starthour), time = hour(starthour)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = ntrips)) +
  geom_line() +
  sugrrants::facet_calendar(~ date) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(6, 18))
```

When a *tsibble* is set up, it takes care of updating key and index throughout the pipeline. Will two user groups, customers and subscribers, have different bike trip histories during a day? The interested subjects shift from every single bike `bikeid` to each user type `usertype`.

```{r usertype}
usertype_ts <- nycbikes_ts %>% 
  group_by(usertype) %>% 
  index_by(hour = hour(starttime)) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_tripd = mean(tripduration),
    ntrips = n()
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

Citi bike members commute more frequently with bikes for short distance, whereas one-time customers tend to travel for a longer period but ride much less.

```{r usertype-plot, fig.height = 3}
library(patchwork)
p1 <- usertype_ts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = ntrips, colour = usertype)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = usertype)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p2 <- usertype_ts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = avg_tripd, colour = usertype)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = usertype))
p1 + p2
```

## Ending

A large chunk of **tsibble**'s functions that are dedicated to performing rolling window operations are left untouched in this post. You may like to read more about rolling window [here](https://pkg.earo.me/tsibble/articles/window.html). 

I have added parallel support to them in `v0.6.2`, prefixed with `future_` (like `future_slide()`) by taking advantage of the awesome **furrr** package.

The **tsibble** package forms the infrastructure for new forecasting software, [**fable**](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable). I will be speaking about a streamlined workflow for tidy time series analysis, including forecasting *tsibble* (goodbye to `ts`) at [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) in January.
