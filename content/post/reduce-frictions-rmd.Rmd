```

I write my thesis in [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). Each chapter is a standalone paper, with the pdf output in mind initially. When I assembled them together for the thesis, I hoped `bookdown::gitbook` should just work. In contrast to the nice pdf, the compiling for html complained bitterly: images not shown, `??` in cross-references, and etc. While fixing bits and pieces, I've learned several tips to lubricate this process.

## Automatic switch between png and pdf for external figures with `knitr.graphics.auto_pdf = TRUE`

We let **knitr** to take care of the plotting device for R figures: pdf for latex and png for html, by default. However, we often rely on external figures to demonstrate conceptual models. We end up exporting a set of images with identical names but different extensions, `ext-fig.pdf` and `ext-fig.png`, in order to maintain high-quality images for pdf and html. To insert images, we use `![]()`, that inevitably lends itself to an `if-else` statement. No doubt [Yihui](http://yihui.name) has already provided an optimal solution to keep away from the sub-optimal `if-else`. It turns out `knitr::include_graphics("ext-fig.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)` does the trick to automatically switch between png and pdf. If you don't want to specify `auto_pdf = TRUE` every time, turn on the option `options("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf" = TRUE)` up front.

Using `include_graphics()` in a knitr chunk allows us to adjust image width/height, add captions, arrange side-by-side figures. The option `out.width = "80%"` remains as is for html and is translated to `out.width = "0.8\\linewidth"` for latex.

````
```{r ext-graphics, fig.cap = "(ref:ext-graphics-cap)", out.width = "80%"}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("ext-fig.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

(ref:ext-graphics-cap) I prefer the figure caption outside the chunk.
(1) Special symbols, like `\@ref()`, don't need escaping. We have to do `fig.cap = \\@ref()` in a chunk.
(2) The chunk won't be re-evaluated, if we modify the caption.

## Output conditional on formats with `knitr::is_[html/latex]_output`

We know **knitr** is a powerhouse that processes our chunks and documents in the background. As an R package, it also comes with many handy functions (hidden gems), such as `include_[app/url/graphics]`. The pair of `is_[html/latex]_output` are useful for producing contextual results due to different media. For example, the online welcome page for [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) starts with "This is the website". This page, however, doesn't occur in the printed version, because "This is not a website".

To handle this kind of disparity, we can apply the following trick. Inline R expressions put the html comment `<!-- -->` around the text if the output format is html. The text only shows up in pdf.

Coupled with the `eval` option, `is_[html/latex]_output` gives the control over whether to evaluate the chunk depending on the output formats.

## Cross-reference with `\@ref()` instead of `\ref{}`

Scientific writing cannot avoid mentioning figures, tables, and equations. I already got used to typing `*italic*` over `\textit{italic}` and `**bold**` over `\textbf{bold}`. But when outputting html, the Rmd cross-reference system has bitten me a bit. Referring to figures and tables with `\ref{}` compiles with no problems for pdf, and it is naturally embedded into the muscle memory as a latex user. I was confronted with the initial surprise that it is not recognisable when switching to the html output. The recommended syntax for cross-references is `\@ref()` in Rmd, which both latex and html embrace with delights.
