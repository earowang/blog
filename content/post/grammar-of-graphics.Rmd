*ggplot2* has probably been a standard tool to craft statistical graphics in the R community over years. If one is asked why using *ggplot2*, you may receive answers like "it makes graphs look pretty". *ggplot2* is yet more than that. The first two letters *gg* is the abbreviation of "grammar of graphics", which implies that there's statistical thinking underlying plots. This framework originated from Leland Wikinson who wrote the book **The Grammar of Graphics** in 1999, and was further developed and implemented by Hadley Wickham, the author of *ggplot2*. **The Grammar of Graphics** is not constrained to graphics, but sheds light on a broad range of topics including objected oriented design (OOD), data structure, statistics, and etc. Wikinson's book on graphic grammar and variable mappings fuels the flourish of *ggplot2* and the *tidyverse* ecosystem; for example, *ggplot2* adapts the OOD approach to ensure the elegant programming and the easy extension of the package as long as graphics are clearly defined by grammatical rules. This post is intended to give a glimpse at the grammar of graphics and discuss the differences between the theory (the book) and the practice (*ggplot2*).

## Graphics vs charts
