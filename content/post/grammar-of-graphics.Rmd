`ggplot2` has probably been a standard tool to make statistical graphics in the R community over years. If one is asked why using `ggplot2`, you may receive answers like "it makes graphs look pretty". `ggplot2` is yet more than that. The first two letters `gg` is the abbreviation of "grammar of graphics", which implies that there's statistical thinking underlying plots. The idea/framework originated from Leland Wikinson who wrote the book "The Grammar of Graphics" in 1999, and was further extended and implemented by Hadley Wickham, the author of `ggplot2`.
